What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
I learned that texts can scare people by reviewing my peer's project. When I read ' "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!",' I was frightened. The text led my attention and scared me even more since it was written in heavy characters. 
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
I would like to apply more interesting details and textures to my own programming projects, such as bold characters and texts showing feeling.   

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
Suggestions I would have for my peer to improve his code are to include more different places, such as forest and lake. It could've been more interesting. 
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
README.md could have been clearer. When he wrote that he fixed the bugs, he could have written what bugs he fixed. He also could have used complete sentences for README.md instead of using incomplete sentences.  
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
There was nothing in the code that was confusing to me. Everything was stragihtforward. 
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
The repository contains an appropriate LICENSE. It contains current year and his full name. 
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
He could have written what bugs he fixed to the README.md to make it more descriptive. 
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
I liked every detail of the code. I felt like I was in the game. I was able to feel emotion, such as fear and anxiety. He edited LICENSE and wrote a summary of what he did while working on the assignment on README.md. He did amazingly.
